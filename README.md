# Born2BeRoot (and not to do reboot)

# Mandatory Part:
Is a system administration project whose aim is to create and configure a virtual server using Linux. It is necessary to install the server on a virtual machine, configure user permissions, create a password policy and install and configure some software such as SSH, firewall and other system administration utilities, all without using a graphical interface, using only command lines. In addition, a script is created which reports on the system's settings every 10 minutes.

# Bonus Part:
Set up partitions correctly, using LVM.
Set up a functional WordPress website with the following services: Lighttpd, Maria-DB, and PHP.
Set up a service of your choice (Cockpit installed, an interactive server admin interface. It is easy to use and very lightweight. Cockpit interacts directly with the operating system from a real Linux session in a browser.)
